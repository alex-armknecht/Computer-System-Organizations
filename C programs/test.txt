One, two, three
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
A big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk (shh) but we don't listen
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
Five foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old sh- but a different day
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby, this is what the night is for
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight let's just pretend
I don't wanna stop so give me more
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, you and me
Stumblin' in the street
Singin', singin', singin', singin'
Midnight memories
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
